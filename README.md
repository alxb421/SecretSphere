# SecretSphere - a PHP project
This Chat was created for those who want privacy and want to be 100% sure that what they are talking is really private, so no chat saving involved.
## Contributors
See AUTHORS and COPYRIGHT for the list of contributors.
## Building
SecretSphere uses [Python](https://python.org) as its GUI app. For the server 
part, it uses PHP.
You can quickly setup and use SecretSphere by doing the following:

## Running
[ work in progress ]

## Commands
SecretShpere got some commands to make it easier to use.

Remember the BUZZ from YahooMessenger? It is here! Just send `/buzz`
command and it does the job.

Someone is passing by, or ultra sensitive infos are being shared through the app?
Use the `/delete` or `/del` command and instantly clear the char
for all members in that specific chat room.

## Developing
You can find more information about SecretSphere development in the
