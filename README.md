part, it uses PHP.
You can quickly setup and use SecretSphere by doing the following:

install python
install all pip requirements
run the launcher_debug
create user and connect to room
Run the install.bat script
```

## Commands
SecretShpere got some commands to make it easier to use.

Remember the BUZZ from YahooMessenger? It is here! Just send `/buzz`
command and it does the job.

Someone is passing by, or ultra sensitive infos are being shared through the app?
Use the `/delete` or `/del` command and instantly clear the char
for all members in that specific chat room.

## Developing
